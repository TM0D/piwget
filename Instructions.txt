There are several options you can choose between. At my work we are using VLC to stream video captured by Raspberry Pi Camera from our server-rooms to the office. One downside of this is that there are about 5 seconds delay and I haven't found a solution to this. The following is our setup:

1. Have raspbian installed and updated and make sure your camera is enabled (you enable this by running sudo raspi-config and choose Enable Camera)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

2. Install vlc

sudo apt-get install vlc

3. Create a script to start the stream with the following content, or run the command (you can't do anything else if you just run the command).

sudo nano myscript.sh
raspivid -o - -t 0 -hf -w 640 -h 360 -fps 25 | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554}' :demux=h264

4. Make the script runable

sudo chmod +x myscript.sh

5. If you want to start the stream automatically you have to add the script to crontab. To make this work I had to make another script runned by cron (OBS! VLC can't be run as sudo so make sure you're in the right cron). sudo nano myscript2.sh:

#!/bin/bash
/path/to/myscript.sh
Then:

sudo chmod +x myscript2.sh
crontab -e
@reboot /path/to/myscript2.sh

6. To watch the videostream, open VLC on a computer on the same network as the raspberry pi you are using for streaming. Press Media -> Open Networkstream and paste the following in the field:

rtsp://[IP].[TO].[THE].[PI]:8554/
If you don't care about FPS (frames per second) and don't want any delay you could use MJPEG. You can read more about this HERE
